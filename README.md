# Scripting_the_WWE_using_DataScience

## Overview
The WWE Narrative Project harnesses data science to align WWE character development with fan perceptions. By analyzing fan comments and wrestler information, the project seeks to script storylines that resonate with the audience.

## Data Source
1. Over 10,000 fan comments
2. Information on 180+ WWE wrestlers
3. Data scraped from online platforms

## Key Elements
1. Sentiment Analysis: Assessing fan comments to gauge wrestler popularity and audience engagement.
2. Wrestler Analysis: Evaluating wrestlers based on factors like persona, mic skills, and in-ring performance.
3. Script Adjustment: Recommending storyline changes to enhance wrestler appeal and audience interest.

## Objectives

2. Use fan sentiment and wrestler data to inform storyline developments.

## Methodology
1. Data Scraping: Extracting large volumes of fan comments and wrestler data from the web.
2. Sentiment Analysis: Utilizing Python's NLTK package to analyze fan sentiments.
